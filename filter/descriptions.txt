This extension brings filter options similar to those on the YouTube home screen to pages like Subscriptions and Library.

<Filters>

The following filters are available:
- Live
- Streamed
- Videos
- Shorts
- Scheduled
- Notifications On
- Notifications Off
- Unwatched
- Watched

By enabling multi-selection in the settings, you can combine multiple filters. For example, selecting both "Live" and "Streamed" will display videos that are either live or have already been streamed.

You can also customize the order and display names of the filters in the settings.


<Keyword Search>

You can filter videos using keywords. For example, entering "News" will display videos with "News" in the title.

Keyword search also supports filtering in the Sidebar Subscriptions, Notifications, and Save to playlist sections.
