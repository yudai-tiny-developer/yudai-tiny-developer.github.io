This extension temporarily increases the playback speed of YouTube live streams with DVR enabled when a delay is detected (i.e., the red "LIVE" indicator turns gray), helping you catch up to real time.

When "Aggressive mode" is enabled in the settings, the extension continues increasing playback speed to catch up to real time as long as there is buffer, even if YouTube has not detected a delay. Aggressive mode also works on YouTube live streams where DVR is disabled.

Additional features include:
- Displaying the current playback speed
- Displaying the number of seconds delayed
- Displaying the remaining buffer size
- Predicting and showing the time you will catch up to real time at the current speed
- Displaying the elapsed time of the live stream
- Copying the current timestamp to the clipboard by clicking the elapsed time display
