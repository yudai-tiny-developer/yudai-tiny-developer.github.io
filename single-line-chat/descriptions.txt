This extension provides the following features to improve YouTube live chat:

- Displays each message in a single line. This ensures that even long messages spanning multiple lines take up uniform space. Hovering over a message will display its full content as usual.
- Hides icons, sender names, badges, and XP from messages.
- Differentiates message text and background colors based on user type: general users, members, moderators, and owners.
